# Roll-A-Dice-Game
# How to Play
The objective of the game is to score the highest number of points possible without going over 100. 
Each turn, the player can roll a die as many times as they wish. 
The number rolled on the die is added to the player's score for that turn. 
The player may choose to hold at any time, which ends their turn and adds the score for that turn to their overall score.
If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all points for that turn.
